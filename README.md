# Food Ordering System Project

This is an example project that I am coding along while studying the Udemy course [Microservices: Clean Architecture, DDD, SAGA, Outbox & Kafka](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-clean-architecture-ddd-saga-outbox-kafka-kubernetes/) by Ali Gelenler.

Food ordering system is developed using a micro services, clean and hexagonal architecture and DDD design patterns.

Services communicate via events and Kafka is used as the event bus.

Project also demonstrates other patterns suchs as Outbox, SAGA and event sourcing.
